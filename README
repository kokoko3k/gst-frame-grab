When using screen grasbbers to drive my leds, i've stuttering on the screen if the gpu is under
heavy load.

Since driving leds does not require the full screen capture, this script come to help by capturing 
only part of the screen, the frame of the screen.
It is intended to feed hypergrabgb, which in turn feeds hyperiond.
It is way lighter on resources than full screen grab.
Apart of the advantage of grabbing less, and so less stress for Xorg, the other Pro is that it grab screen in "slices"
and from my experience, this allow the gpu heavy app (the game!) to render between a slice grab and the other.
Sure, in that case the slices are not synchronized, but you cannot really tell by watching the leds., so it is Ok.

USE:
  gstgrab.sh start_x start_y in_width in_height fps border_size out_width out_height preview(=1|0)

Use gstgrab.sh standalonde with:
  gstgrab.sh 0 0 1920 1080 20 200 16 9 1
...having the last parameter (preview) =1 will open a window with the live capture so that you can tune it.

Done that, feed it to hypergrabgb that way:
  hypergrabgb.gambas -e 16 -d 9 -q -z "/koko/tmp/gst.sh 0 0 1920 1080 20 200 16 9 0"
  (see that -e 16 -d 9 have to match out_width and out_height of gstgrab.sh)
